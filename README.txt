Project Goal:

This project is to build a Farm manager program and help the farmers and cheese
companies to analyze the milk weights so they could better learn the features of 
the milk selling.


Project Description:

This program can read data in files and add, remove, edit, as well as get the report according to farms, year, month, as well as the date range. The data in all reports are in ascending order according to weight. 


Instructions:

1. Start this program
2. Upload the data file to this program. (The upload box is on the right side of the main interface.)
3. Now you can add, remove, and edit data. Also, you can get the report according to farms, year, month, as well as the date range.


Note: 

1. When you want to use the annual report, please upload all data files for 12 months to get the complete annual report.
2. Can only upload one file at a time, but you can upload files many times.


Future Work Section:

We will improve the program by allowing users to decide how the data will be ordered. Also, we may present the data in more intuitive ways, like broken line graph, pie diagram, scatter diagram.
